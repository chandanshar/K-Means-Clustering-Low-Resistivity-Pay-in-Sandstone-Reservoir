K-Means Clustering on Well Log Data for Low Resisitivity Pay Zone
In this project, we have carried out unsupervised learning classification using K-means clustering method.

### K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is a very commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It is used to group data into K number of clusters by minimising the distance between the data point and the centroid. 

The centroid is initialised at k random points in the data space and all points around it are assigned to the relevant cluster based on the distance to the centroid. The centroid is then adjusted to the central point of the cluster and the points surrounding it are reassigned. This continues until either there is no change in the centroids or the points remain in the same cluster or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Dataset
The dataset we are using for this project forms part of a Machine Learning competition run by Xeek and FORCE 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4351155). The objective of the compettion was to predict lithology from existing labelled data. The dataset consists of 118 wells from the Norwegian Sea.
